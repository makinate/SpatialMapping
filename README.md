# Exp1_LowVisionShader
Basic app for Shaders for Low Vision experiment. 


## Basic Unity and Gitignore instructions
Make sure that .gitignore file and Unity settings are correct and not overwritten to make sure the SpatialMapping hierarchy and settings are
constant across all versions for all users.
- Go to project settings - under Edit -> Project Settings -> Editor
- change Version Control mode setting to support "Visible Meta
Files" and the Asset Serialization mode setting to "Force
Text"

Otherwise terrible things will happen and you will find yourself in git purgatory.
